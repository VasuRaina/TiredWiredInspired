Swift UI app for comparing betting websites

The goal of this app was to have a place where you can agrigate all the popular betting websites and check which ones have the best odds for your favourite bet.

The UI would provide you 3 diffrent options on a card

1. Tired - boring bets, posible not the most favorable odds/low upside

2. Wired - Favorable bets on fun teams, exciting games and pretty good odds to win.

3. Inspired - this option is for people like me the "Sickos". These bets are a crapshoot, they easily could qualify you as a degenerate but, if they hit... you're a legend

The app also has a home page with news article so bettors can stay up to date 

Unfortunately, I experienced some technical dificulties with my computer so this project was made on Xcode 12.4

The idea was to accomodate more features but the scope became a little overwhelming.
Hoping to improve this, not satisfied with how the data is moving through the app, can be a lot cleaner.
